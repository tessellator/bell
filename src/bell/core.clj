(defn route
  "Creates a route to match `method` and `pattern` to `handler`. Returns a ring
   handler that returns the result of `handler` if the request matches, and nil
   otherwise.
   
   `method` should be a keyword that matches an HTTP method, such as `:get`. It
   may also be `:*` to match any method.
   
   `pattern` is a string that describes the (potentially partial) URI for the
   request. The pattern may contain path parameters identified by keywords, such
   as `/users/:id`. In this example, `:id` is a path parameter. When a match is
   found, the route will parse the path parameters into a map attached as
   `:path-params` to the request.

   `pattern` may also be a prefix value. If a pattern ends with `/` (except the 
   root route) or `...`, the pattern is treated as a prefix. Here are some 
   examples. The pattern `/api/` matches `/api/some/other/path` and the pattern
   `/images/image-...` matches `/images/image-logo.png` but not
   `images/logo.png`.
   
   `handler` is a ring handler to handle the request if the method and pattern
   match."
